One of the key goals of RAPIDS is to keep the tools and workflows you are familiar with, but turn them into end-to-end GPU accelerated pipelines. From ETL, exploration, analytics, and visualization - you can take advantage of the speed ups from GPUs.\n",

Stay up to date with our projects on our [Home](https://rapids.ai/), [GitHub](https://github.com/rapidsai), and [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/rapidsai)."
